# NUPS Patch Batch
 Script for quickly patching files with NUPS.
 
# How to Use?
 Include a copy of the base file you want to be patching and make sure the -b param in the script matches your file name and extension. Then drag your ups patch on to the batch file.
 
 If you're not patching a .gba file, make sure to change the extension for the base file and the output file.
 
# Why Use This?
 If you apply a lot of different ups patches to a single file frequently, this can help save you time.
